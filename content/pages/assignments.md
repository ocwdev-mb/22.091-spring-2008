Safety goals and risk informed decision making

Integration of safety analysis into operational requirements


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Use the reactor oversight process site and identify the key safety issues in the last 2 quarters of the reactor nearest your home.

Based on the review of the performance indicators, identify the particular NRC inspection reports upon which the finding is based.

Summarize your review in a two page memo about the condition of this plant and the corrective actions being taken.

Are you satisfied with the safety of this plant?

Preparation for simulator exercise - BWR

Three Mile Island Accident


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Read RogovinReport executive summary

Analyze event from the perspective of why the accident happened and why it became a such serious problem. (Beyond the obvious of failing to recognize the open PORV). Given your experience in the simulators (recall that the simulator you were in did not represent control rooms of the 1970's).

\- Consider operator training  
\- Regulations  
\- Technical response  
\- Knowledge  
\- Control room design and instrumentation  
\- Fundamental design of reactor  
\- Management culture

Read steam generator report for background on designs: 3 pages of analysis

Davis Besse Near Miss 2002


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Review the FENOC (Davis Besse) request for continued operation sent in late 2001 to justify operation until the spring out.

Based on the information provided and the experience with Alloy 600, provide a technically based answer to the request – you may want to review the NRC letter granting approval to see if you agree – why and why not.

Safety culture


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Safety culture is an important aspect of safe nuclear plant support and operations. At present it is not "regulated" by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and only indirectly assessed by INPO.

Question: If you were a regulator, what regulation would you suggest with associated metrics to regulate safety culture? Please specifically identify the metric and how it will be measured considering all the factors associated with safety culture. Justify your answer.

Read Sorensen article on "Safety Culture: A Survey of the State of the Art".
